# OHS Compliance Monitoring — Quick start


This repo contains a containerized microservice system for Occupational Health & Safety Compliance Monitoring.


## What this includes
- Microservices (API, Auth, Worker, UI)
- Kubernetes manifests to deploy to your on-prem cluster
- Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) for CI/CD that builds images, pushes to ACR, and deploys to Kubernetes
- Azure helper scripts to create an Azure VM for Jenkins and an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Prometheus and Grafana manifest instructions


## Quick workflow
1. Provision Azure resources (ACR, VM) with `azure-setup/az_acr_and_vm.sh`.
2. Install Jenkins on the Azure VM using `azure-setup/setup-jenkins-ubuntu.sh`.
3. From Jenkins, the pipeline will build images and push to ACR.
4. Kubernetes cluster pulls images from ACR using a `docker-registry` secret and deploys manifests in `infra/k8s/`.


## Pre-requisites
- Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`).
- kubectl configured for your Kubernetes cluster and connectivity from Jenkins to the cluster.
- Docker installed locally to build and test images.
- GitHub repo created and this tree pushed.


## Notes
- Kubernetes cluster is expected to be externally-managed (on-prem or VMs). This repo does not create AKS.
- Use least-privilege service accounts for Jenkins to access Kubernetes.
